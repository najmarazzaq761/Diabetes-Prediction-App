# Diabetes Prediction App

This repository contains a Streamlit application for predicting diabetes using machine learning models. The app provides a user-friendly interface for making diabetes predictions based on various input features.

## Overview

The Diabetes Prediction App leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided input data. The application is built using Streamlit, enabling the creation of interactive and visually appealing web applications with minimal code.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can input various features related to diabetes prediction.
- **Real-time Predictions**: The app provides real-time predictions based on the input features.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visual representations of the input data and prediction results.
- **Model Interpretability**: Insights into how different features contribute to the prediction.

## Installation

To run the Diabetes Prediction App locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/najmarazzaq/Diabetes-Prediction-App.git
   cd Diabetes-Prediction-App
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run 03_diabetes_prediction_app.py
   ```

## Usage
